# Fraction

Python provides a built-in `Fraction` class that lets you do precise arithmetic on the rationals, with automatic reduction/normalization:

```py
>>> from fractions import Fraction
>>> half = Fraction(1, 2)
>>> half
Fraction(1, 2)
>>> str(half)
'1/2'
>>> quarter = Fraction(1, 4)
>>> half + quarter
Fraction(3, 4)
>>> half + quarter + quarter
Fraction(1, 1)
>>> int(half + quarter + quarter)
1
>>> int(half)
0
```

Caveat: the automatic reduction makes `Fraction` unsuitable for use-cases where you want to keep track of the original denominator, for example, if you're calculating running averages. Likewise time-signatures in music _look_ like fractions but actually are ratios (eg, in music `4/4` is not the same as `2/2` and neither are `1`).
